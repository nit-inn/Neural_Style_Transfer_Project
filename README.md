# Project Overview
To develop a neural network model capable of applying the artistic style of one image (style image) to another image (content image), effectively creating a new image that retains the recognizable content of the original while adopting the artistic characteristics of the style image. This involves understanding the underlying principles of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and their application in separating and recombining image content and style. The project aims to explore and implement advanced deep learning techniques to enhance the quality and efficiency of style transfer. Furthermore, the project seeks to address potential challenges in preserving content integrity while effectively incorporating stylistic features, ensuring the output images are both aesthetically pleasing and contextually accurate.

# Installation Instuctions
Setup a proper jupyter notebook environment in your system, can refer "Anaconda Navigator" for that.
Code will run on cpu but for faster results, and if possible, go for gpu environment, under anaconda navigator.

# Usage
For proper functioning of the code, Make sure to provide correct names of both content and style image. And both the input images must be present in the same folder in which this ipynb file is saved.

# Dependencies
You should have proper knowledge about python and it's libraries to understand the code.
Some libraries like:
Tensorflow, Numpy, Matplotlib must be installed in your system.
